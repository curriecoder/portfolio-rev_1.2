    <p>
      Born in Missouri and raised in Arizona, I have spent many of my adult
      years looking for my tribe, I feel I finally have found them in the
      field of programming! My first time experiencing the joys (and headaches)
      of coding was when I was eleven years old. At that time my school was
      working with HTML 3.2, doing styling in-line. I continued playing around
      with HTML and CSS for many years and now I'm back at it with the LPS
      UPenn Coding Bootcamp! I served in the U.S. Army for five years straight
      out of high school, learning much about the world during that time.
      After that chapter had closed, I began searching for my next adventure
      in past passions. I started self educating in C++ and eventually Python
      to see if it was an activity I still enjoyed. The excitement was still
      present with every new hurdle passed and knowledge gained. I am thrilled
      to be a part of this challenging curriculum with the wonderful staff
      that is here to help transform me into a full-fledged web developer!
